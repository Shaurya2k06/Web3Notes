# History

The main evolutionary steps of the internet are often represented as the qualitatively different phases dubbed Web1, Web2, and Web3.

## Web1

In the Web1 era, users couldn't change online data or upload their own content to the websites they were interacting with. The internet back then consisted of static HTML pages that enabled simple, one-way experiences, such as reading information forums.

## Web2

Web2 allowed content consumption and simple interaction. Then, Web2 gradually emerged as a more interactive internet where users were more involved in generating their own content. Since these modes of online interactions were mainly facilitated by social media platforms, Web2 saw the rise of new types of centralized tech giants.

The current Web2 ecosystem is changing again as more of its failings get exposed. For example, internet users have become more concerned about data tracking and ownership, as well as censorship issues.

The power of centralized companies has become especially noticeable when they began leveraging it to ban specific users and organizations from their platforms. Web2 companies also use the data to keep users on their websites and create targeted ads for third parties’ benefit. Such economic incentives can drive such companies to act not in users’ best interest.

## Web3

The vision of Web3 is that of the next step toward a better internet. Its central promises include making online platforms decentralized, trustless, and permissionless. It could also bring about digital ownership, digital-native payments, and censorship-resistance as a new standard of Web products and services.

Blockchain and crypto are perfectly positioned to become essential technologies of Web3 because they are inherently decentralized, permitting anyone to record information on-chain, tokenize assets, and create digital identities.

### Key Features of Web3

- **Decentralization**: Unlike Web2, where data is stored in centralized servers, Web3 aims to distribute data across multiple nodes, reducing the risk of data breaches and increasing transparency.
- **Trustless**: Transactions and interactions can occur without the need for a trusted third party, thanks to blockchain technology.
- **Permissionless**: Anyone can participate in the Web3 ecosystem without needing authorization from a central authority.
- **Digital Ownership**: Users can truly own their digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs, without relying on intermediaries.
- **Censorship Resistance**: Information and transactions are less susceptible to censorship, ensuring freedom of expression and access.

### Potential Challenges

- **Scalability**: Current blockchain technologies face challenges in handling large volumes of transactions quickly and efficiently.
- **User Experience**: The complexity of using blockchain-based applications can be a barrier to widespread adoption.
- **Regulation**: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can impact the growth and development of Web3.
