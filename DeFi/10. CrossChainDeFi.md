# Cross-Chain DeFi

## Overview

Cross-chain DeFi enables assets and data to move between different blockchain networks, expanding liquidity and composability across ecosystems.

## Bridge Types

### 1. Lock and Mint Bridges

**Mechanism:**
```
Source Chain:
1. Lock native asset in smart contract
2. Emit event

Destination Chain:
3. Mint wrapped version of asset
4. User receives wrapped tokens
```

**Example: WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin)**
```
Bitcoin → Ethereum
1. Send BTC to custodian
2. Custodian locks BTC
3. Mint WBTC on Ethereum (1:1 ratio)
4. User receives WBTC

Redemption:
1. Burn WBTC
2. Custodian releases BTC
```

**Pros:**
- Simple mechanism
- Maintains 1:1 peg

**Cons:**
- Centralized custody
- Trust required
- Single point of failure
