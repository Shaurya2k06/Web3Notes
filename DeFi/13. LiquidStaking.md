# Liquid Staking

## Overview

Liquid staking allows users to stake assets (like ETH) while maintaining liquidity through derivative tokens. This solves the opportunity cost problem of traditional staking.

## The Problem with Traditional Staking

**Ethereum Staking:**
```
Stake: 32 ETH
Lock period: Indefinite (until withdrawals enabled)
Yield: ~4-5% APY
Problem: Capital locked, no liquidity
```

**Opportunity Cost:**
```
Staked ETH: 4% APY
DeFi Opportunities: 10-20% APY
Cost: 6-16% APY foregone
```

## Liquid Staking Solution

**Mechanism:**
```
1. Deposit ETH to liquid staking protocol
2. Receive liquid staking derivative (LSD)
3. LSD represents staked ETH + rewards
4. Use LSD in DeFi while earning staking rewards
```

## Major Protocols

### 1. Lido Finance

**stETH (Staked ETH):**

**Mechanism:**
```
Deposit: 10 ETH
Receive: 10 stETH
Lido stakes ETH with validators
stETH balance increases daily (rebasing)
```
