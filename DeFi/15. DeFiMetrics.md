# DeFi Metrics and Analytics

## Overview

Understanding DeFi metrics is essential for evaluating protocols, making investment decisions, and assessing ecosystem health.

## Protocol Metrics

### 1. Total Value Locked (TVL)

**Definition:** Total value of assets deposited in a protocol.

**Calculation:**
```
TVL = Σ(Token Amount × Token Price)

Example:
Protocol holds:
- 10,000 ETH @ $2,000 = $20M
- 5M USDC @ $1 = $5M
- 100 WBTC @ $40,000 = $4M

TVL = $20M + $5M + $4M = $29M
```

**Significance:**
- Measure of protocol adoption
- Proxy for liquidity
- Security indicator (more TVL = more at stake)
- Not always correlated with revenue

**Limitations:**
- Can be inflated (recursive deposits)
- Doesn't account for token price
- Doesn't show actual usage
- Can be manipulated
