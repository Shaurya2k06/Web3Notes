```

### 3. Tokenized Commodities

**Gold:**

**Paxos Gold (PAXG):**
```
Backing: 1 PAXG = 1 troy oz gold
Storage: London vaults
Audits: Monthly
Redeemable: Yes (minimum 1 oz)
```

**Tether Gold (XAUT):**

### 4. Tokenized Credit

**Description:** Loans to real-world borrowers represented as tokens.

**Centrifuge:**

**Mechanism:**
```
1. Asset Originator creates pool
2. Uploads real-world assets (invoices, mortgages)
3. Issues tokens backed by assets
4. DeFi investors provide capital
5. Borrowers repay loans
6. Investors earn yield
```

**Example Pool:**
```
Asset: Small business invoices
Originator: Verified lender
Pool Size: $5M
APY: 8-12%
Risk: Senior/junior tranches
```

**Tranches:**
```
Senior (TIN):
- First to be repaid
- Lower risk
- Lower yield (6-8%)
- Protected by junior tranche

Junior (DROP):
- Last to be repaid
- Higher risk
- Higher yield (10-15%)
- Absorbs first losses
```

**Goldfinch:**

**Mechanism:**
```
1. Borrowers (emerging markets) request loans
2. Backers (experts) evaluate and provide first-loss capital
3. Liquidity Providers supply senior capital
4. Loans disbursed in USDC
5. Borrowers repay with interest
6. Yield distributed to investors
```

**Example:**
```
Borrower: Fintech in Nigeria
Loan: $1M USDC
Term: 12 months
Rate: 15% APY
Backers: Provide $100K (10% first-loss)
LPs: Provide $900K (senior)

If default:
- Backers lose first
- LPs protected up to 10% loss
```

**Maple Finance:**

**Mechanism:**
```
1. Pool Delegates (institutions) create lending pools
2. Underwrite borrowers (KYC/AML)
3. Lenders deposit USDC/WETH
4. Borrowers receive undercollateralized loans
5. Repayments distributed to lenders
```

**Risk Assessment:**
```
- Credit checks
- Financial statements
- Collateral (off-chain)
- Personal guarantees
- Legal agreements
```

### 5. Tokenized Carbon Credits

**Description:** Carbon offsets represented as tokens.

**Toucan Protocol:**

**Mechanism:**
```
1. Bridge carbon credits on-chain
2. Tokenize as TCO2 tokens
3. Deposit into carbon pools (BCT, NCT)
4. Use in DeFi applications
```

**Base Carbon Tonne (BCT):**
```
- Pool of verified carbon credits
- 1 BCT = 1 tonne CO2 offset

## RWA Protocols Deep Dive

### MakerDAO RWA Vaults

**Integration:**
```
MakerDAO accepts RWAs as collateral for DAI

Current RWAs:

- Real estate
- Trade finance
- Revenue-based financing
```

**Example: 6s Capital**
```
Vault: RWA009-A
Collateral: Trade receivables
Debt Ceiling: $100M
Stability Fee: 3.5%
Liquidation Ratio: 105%

Process:
1. 6s Capital originates trade finance loans
2. Packages loans as collateral
3. Mints DAI against collateral
4. Deploys DAI in DeFi
5. Repays as loans mature
```

**Benefits for MakerDAO:**
```
- Real yield (not just crypto volatility)

## Technical Implementation

### Token Standards

**ERC-1400 (Security Token):**
```solidity
interface IERC1400 {
    // Document management
    function getDocument(bytes32 name) external view returns (string memory, bytes32);
    function setDocument(bytes32 name, string calldata uri, bytes32 documentHash) external;
    
    // Transfer restrictions
    function canTransfer(address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) 
        external view returns (byte, bytes32);
    
    // Forced transfers (for compliance)
    function controllerTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) 
        external;
    
    // Issuance/redemption
    function issue(address tokenHolder, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external;
    function redeem(uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external;
}
```

**ERC-3643 (T-REX):**
```solidity
// Compliant security token with identity management
interface IERC3643 {
    // Identity verification
    function isVerified(address user) external view returns (bool);
    
    // Transfer with compliance check
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    
    // Compliance rules
    function canTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) 
        external view returns (bool);
}
```

### Oracle Integration

**Chainlink Proof of Reserve:**
```solidity
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

contract RWAToken {
    AggregatorV3Interface internal reserveFeed;
    
    constructor(address _reserveFeed) {
        reserveFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_reserveFeed);
    }
    
    function getReserves() public view returns (int) {
        (
            uint80 roundID,
            int reserves,
            uint startedAt,
            uint timeStamp,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = reserveFeed.latestRoundData();
        
        require(timeStamp > 0, "Round not complete");
        return reserves;
    }
    
    function isFullyBacked() public view returns (bool) {
        int reserves = getReserves();
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();
        return uint256(reserves) >= supply;
    }
}
```

### Compliance Layer

**Transfer Restrictions:**
```solidity
contract CompliantToken is ERC20 {
    mapping(address => bool) public whitelist;
    mapping(address => bool) public blacklist;
    mapping(address => uint256) public maxBalance;
    
    modifier onlyWhitelisted(address account) {
        require(whitelist[account], "Not whitelisted");
        require(!blacklist[account], "Blacklisted");
        _;
    }
    
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) 
        public 
        override 
        onlyWhitelisted(msg.sender)
        onlyWhitelisted(to)
        returns (bool) 
    {
        require(balanceOf(to) + amount <= maxBalance[to], "Exceeds max balance");
        return super.transfer(to, amount);
    }
    
    function addToWhitelist(address account) external onlyOwner {
        whitelist[account] = true;
    }
    
    function addToBlacklist(address account) external onlyOwner {
        blacklist[account] = true;
        // Optionally freeze funds
    }
}
```

## RWA Risks

### 1. Legal and Regulatory Risk

**Challenges:**
```
- Unclear regulations
- Jurisdiction conflicts
- Securities laws
- Property rights
- Bankruptcy proceedings
```

**Example:**
```
If RWA issuer goes bankrupt:
- Are token holders creditors?
- What priority in bankruptcy?
- Can assets be seized?
- How to enforce claims?
```

### 2. Custody and Verification Risk

**Questions:**
```
- Who holds the physical asset?
- How to verify it exists?
- What if custodian fails?
- How to audit regularly?
```

**Mitigation:**
```
- Third-party custody
- Regular audits
- Insurance
- Proof of Reserve oracles
- Legal agreements
```

### 3. Liquidity Risk

**Challenges:**
```
- Limited secondary market
- Large bid-ask spreads
- Redemption delays
- Minimum redemption amounts
```

**Example:**
```
Tokenized real estate:
- Property worth $1M
- 1000 tokens issued
- Only 10 tokens trade monthly
- Illiquid market
- Hard to exit position
```

### 4. Valuation Risk

**Challenges:**
```
- How to price illiquid assets?
- Who determines fair value?
- Frequency of revaluation?
- Disputes over valuation?
```

**Example:**
```
Tokenized art:
- Last sold for $1M (5 years ago)
- Current value unknown
- No comparable sales
- Subjective valuation
```

### 5. Counterparty Risk

**Risks:**
```
- Issuer default
- Custodian failure
- Servicer bankruptcy
- Borrower default (for credit)
```

**Mitigation:**
```
- Due diligence
- Diversification
- Insurance
- Legal recourse
- Overcollateralization
```
