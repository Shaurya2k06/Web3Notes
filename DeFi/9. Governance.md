# DeFi Governance

## Overview

DeFi governance allows token holders to collectively make decisions about protocol parameters, upgrades, and treasury management. It's the mechanism for decentralized control.

## Governance Models

### 1. Token-Based Voting

**One Token = One Vote**

Most common model where voting power is proportional to token holdings.

**Characteristics:**
- Simple and transparent
- Plutocratic (whales have more power)
- Vulnerable to governance attacks
- Can be delegated

**Example: Compound**
```
COMP token holders vote on proposals
1 COMP = 1 vote
Proposal threshold: 100,000 COMP
Quorum: 400,000 COMP
Voting period: 3 days
Timelock: 2 days
```

**Voting Process:**
```
1. Create proposal (requires threshold)
2. Voting period begins
3. Token holders vote (for/against/abstain)
4. If quorum reached and majority approves
5. Timelock delay
6. Execute proposal
```
