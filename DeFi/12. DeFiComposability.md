# DeFi Composability

## Overview

Composability is DeFi's superpower - the ability to combine protocols like "money legos" to create new financial products. It's what makes DeFi more than the sum of its parts.

## What is Composability?

### Definition

The ability for different protocols to seamlessly interact and build upon each other without permission.

**Key Properties:**
1. **Permissionless:** No approval needed to integrate
2. **Atomic:** Operations succeed or fail together
3. **Synchronous:** Instant execution within one transaction
4. **Transparent:** All code is open and auditable

### The Money Lego Analogy

```
Traditional Finance:
- Walled gardens
- APIs require partnerships
- Slow integration (months/years)
- Permission required

DeFi:
- Open protocols
- Direct smart contract calls
- Instant integration (hours/days)
- Permissionless
```

## Composability Examples

### 1. Leveraged Yield Farming

Combine lending + DEX + yield farming:

```
1. Deposit ETH to Aave
2. Borrow USDC against ETH
3. Swap USDC to ETH on Uniswap
4. Deposit ETH to Aave
5. Repeat (recursive leverage)
6. Stake LP tokens for rewards

All in one transaction!
