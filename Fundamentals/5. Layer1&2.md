# Layer 1, and 2

## Layer 1

Layer 1 refers to a base network, such as Bitcoin, BNB Chain, or Ethereum, and its underlying infrastructure. Layer-1 blockchains can validate and finalize transactions without the need for another network. Making improvements to the scalability of layer-1 networks is difficult, as weâ€™ve seen with Bitcoin.

### Examples of Layer 1

- **Bitcoin**: The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, which operates on its own blockchain.
- **Ethereum**: A decentralized platform that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).
- **BNB Chain**: A blockchain network developed by Binance for running smart contracts and dApps.

## Layer 2

As a solution, developers create layer-2 protocols that rely on the layer-1 network for security and consensus. Bitcoin's Lightning Network is one example of a layer-2 protocol. It allows users to make transactions freely before recording them into the main chain.

Layer-2 solutions build on layer 1 and rely on it to finalize their transactions. One famous example is the Lightning Network. The Bitcoin network under heavy traffic can take hours to process transactions. The Lightning Network lets users make speedy payments with their Bitcoin off the main chain, and the final balance is reported back to the main chain later. This essentially bundles everyone's transactions into one final record, saving time and resources.

### Examples of Layer 2

- **Lightning Network**: A layer-2 solution for Bitcoin that enables fast and low-cost transactions.
- **Optimistic Rollups**: A layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that increases transaction throughput.
- **zk-Rollups**: Another Ethereum layer-2 solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to enhance scalability.

Layer-2 solutions are crucial for scaling blockchain networks. They help reduce congestion on the main chain and lower transaction fees. Other examples of layer-2 solutions include Ethereum's Optimistic Rollups and zk-Rollups, which also aim to improve transaction throughput and efficiency.
