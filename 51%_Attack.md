## 51% Attack

In Proof-of-Work (PoW) based systems, mining involves significant investment in electricity and computational resources. A miner’s performance is determined by their computational power, often referred to as hash power or hash rate. Numerous mining nodes across various locations compete to find a valid block hash and earn newly generated bitcoins.

However, what happens when the hash rate is not well distributed? What if a single entity or organization gains more than 50% of the hashing power? This scenario can lead to what is known as a 51% attack, or majority attack.

A 51% attack is a potential threat to a blockchain network where a single entity or organization controls the majority of the hash rate, potentially causing network disruption. In this situation, the attacker could:

- Intentionally exclude or modify the order of transactions.
- Reverse transactions they made while in control, leading to double-spending.

However, a majority attack would not allow the attacker to:

- Reverse transactions from other users.
- Prevent transactions from being created and broadcasted to the network.
- Change the block’s reward.
- Create coins out of thin air.
- Steal coins that never belonged to them.

A 51% attack on Bitcoin is highly unlikely due to the network's size. As a blockchain grows larger, the probability of a single entity or group obtaining enough computing power to dominate the network decreases significantly.
