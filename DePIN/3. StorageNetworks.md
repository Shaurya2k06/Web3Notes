# DePIN Storage Networks

## Overview

Decentralized storage networks provide cloud storage through distributed nodes rather than centralized data centers. These networks offer censorship resistance, data redundancy, and often lower costs than traditional cloud providers.

## Filecoin

### Overview

**The Largest Decentralized Storage Network:**
```
Launched: 2020
Storage Capacity: 20+ EiB (Exbibytes)
Storage Providers: 3000+
Token: FIL
Market Cap: $2-3 billion
Parent: Protocol Labs (also created IPFS)
```

**Mission:**
```
"Store humanity's most important information"
- Decentralized storage marketplace
- Preserve human knowledge
- Censorship-resistant
- Economically sustainable
```

### Architecture

**Components:**

**1. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):**
```
Content-addressed storage
- Files identified by hash (CID)
- Distributed across network
- Peer-to-peer retrieval
- Deduplication built-in

Example CID:
bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi
```

**2. Filecoin Blockchain:**
```
Coordinates storage marketplace
- Storage deals
- Retrieval deals
- Proof verification
- Payment settlement
```

**3. Storage Providers (Miners):**
```
Offer storage capacity
- Seal data (prepare for storage)
- Generate proofs
- Maintain data
- Serve retrievals
```

**4. Clients:**
```
Store data on network
- Create storage deals
- Pay for storage
- Verify proofs
- Retrieve data
```

### Proof Systems

**Proof of Replication (PoRep):**
```
Proves storage provider:
- Stored unique copy of data
- Data is sealed (encoded)
- Cannot deduplicate maliciously

Process:
1. Receive data from client
2. Seal data (slow, compute-intensive)
3. Generate proof of sealing
4. Submit proof to blockchain
5. Proof verified by network
```

**Sealing Process:**
```
Input: Raw data
Steps:
1. Add padding
2. Create Merkle tree
3. Generate replica
4. Compute proof
5. Verify proof

Time: Hours to days (depending on size)
Purpose: Prevent Sybil attacks, ensure unique storage
```

**Proof of Spacetime (PoSt):**
```
Proves storage provider:
- Still storing data over time
- Data is accessible
- No data corruption

Types:
1. WindowPoSt: Periodic proofs (every 24 hours)
2. WinningPoSt: For block rewards

Failure penalty: Slashing
```

**WindowPoSt:**
```
Every 24 hours:
1. Storage provider generates proof
2. Proof covers all stored sectors
3. Submit proof to blockchain
4. Network verifies proof
5. If valid, continue earning
6. If invalid, get slashed

Deadline: 30 minutes per window
Penalty: Loss of collateral + storage power
```

### Token Economics

**FIL Token:**
```
Max Supply: 2 billion FIL
Initial Supply: 1.5 billion FIL
Vesting: 6 years

Distribution:
- Mining rewards: 55%
- Protocol Labs: 10.5%
- Filecoin Foundation: 5%
- Investors: 10%
- Team: 4.5%
- Ecosystem: 15%
```

**Emission Schedule:**
```
Block reward decreases over time
Half-life: 6 years

Year 1: ~400K FIL/day
Year 3: ~300K FIL/day
Year 6: ~200K FIL/day
Year 12: ~100K FIL/day

Plus: 25% baseline minting (network growth bonus)
```

**Collateral Requirements:**
```
Storage providers must lock:
1. Initial pledge: ~0.2 FIL per TiB
2. Storage deal collateral: ~10% of deal value
3. Consensus pledge: For block production

Total: ~20-30% of expected earnings

Purpose:
- Align incentives
- Prevent Sybil attacks
- Ensure data availability
- Punish misbehavior
```

**Slashing Conditions:**
```
Penalties for:
1. Missing WindowPoSt: -5 FIL per sector
2. Terminating deals early: -90 days of rewards
3. Consensus faults: -5 FIL

Slashed funds: Burned (deflationary)
```

### Storage Deals

**Deal Structure:**
```
Client ↔ Storage Provider Agreement

Parameters:
- Data CID (content identifier)
- Size (in bytes)
- Duration (in epochs, ~30 seconds each)
- Price (FIL per byte per epoch)
- Collateral (provider locks FIL)

Example:
- 1 TiB for 180 days
- Price: 0.0000001 FIL/byte/epoch
- Total cost: ~5 FIL
```

**Deal Lifecycle:**
```
1. Client proposes deal
2. Provider accepts deal
3. Client sends data
4. Provider seals data
5. Provider generates PoRep
6. Deal becomes active
7. Provider generates PoSt regularly
8. Deal expires or renews
```

**Verified Deals:**
```
DataCap program:
- Clients get free storage allocation
- For storing valuable data
- Verified by notaries
- 10x multiplier for providers

Purpose: Incentivize useful data storage
```

### Retrieval Market

**Retrieval Deals:**
```
Separate from storage deals
Pay-per-retrieval model

Process:
1. Client requests data (CID)
2. Provider quotes price
3. Client accepts
4. Provider sends data
5. Payment via payment channels

Price: ~$0.01-0.10 per GB
```

**Payment Channels:**
```
Off-chain micropayments
- Open channel with deposit
- Stream payments as data flows
- Close channel when done
- Settle on-chain

Benefits:
- Low latency
- No blockchain congestion
- Efficient for small payments
```

### Economics Analysis

**Storage Provider Costs:**
```
Hardware (128 TiB setup):
- Servers: $20,000
- Storage: $15,000
- Networking: $2,000
- Total: $37,000

Operating Costs (annual):
- Electricity: $5,000
- Internet: $2,000
- Maintenance: $3,000
- Collateral opportunity cost: $5,000
- Total: $15,000/year

Revenue (at $0.0000001 FIL/byte/epoch):
- 128 TiB stored
- 180-day deals
- ~640 FIL earned
- At $5/FIL: $3,200

Break-even: ~12 years (not profitable at current rates)
```

**Profitability Challenges:**
```
Issues:
- Low storage prices
- High hardware costs
- High collateral requirements
- Sealing costs
- Competition

Many providers operate at loss
Betting on future FIL price appreciation

## Arweave

### Overview

**Permanent Storage:**
```
Launched: 2018
Storage: 100+ TB
Transactions: 1.5 billion+
Token: AR
Unique Feature: Pay once, store forever
```

**Blockweave:**
```
Not a blockchain, but a "blockweave"
- Blocks link to previous block AND random old block
- Miners must store old data to mine
- Ensures data persistence
```

### Permanent Storage Model

**One-Time Payment:**
```
Pay once for permanent storage
No recurring fees
Endowment model

Calculation:
Storage cost = Data size × Price per byte
Price includes: 200 years of storage costs

Example:
1 GB = ~$5-10 (one-time)
vs AWS S3: $0.023/GB/month = $5.52/year = $1,104 over 200 years
```

**Endowment Fund:**
```
Storage fees go to endowment
Endowment earns interest
Interest pays for ongoing storage

Assumptions:
- Storage costs decrease 0.5% per year
- Endowment earns 3-5% per year
- Covers storage for 200+ years
```

### Proof of Access

**Mining Mechanism:**
```
Miners must prove they have:
1. Random old block (recall block)
2. New block data

Process:
1. Miner selected based on recall block
2. Must produce recall block quickly
3. If successful, mine new block
4. Earn AR rewards

Incentive: Store more data → Higher chance of mining
```

**Wildfire:**
```
Peer ranking system
- Nodes rank peers by responsiveness
- Prefer fast, reliable peers
- Punish slow or unreliable peers

Result: Fast data propagation
```

### Token Economics

**AR Token:**
```
Supply: 66 million AR
Inflation: Decreasing over time
Block time: ~2 minutes
Block reward: Decreasing

Distribution:
- Mining: 55%
