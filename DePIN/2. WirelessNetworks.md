## Helium Network

### Overview

**The Pioneer:**
```
Launched: 2019
Network Type: LoRaWAN (IoT) + 5G
Nodes: 1 million+ hotspots
Coverage: 190+ countries
Token: HNT (Helium Network Token)
```

**Mission:**
```
"The People's Network"
- Decentralized wireless infrastructure
- Community-owned and operated
- Affordable IoT connectivity
- Global coverage
```

### Network Architecture

**Three Networks:**

**1. IoT Network (LoRaWAN):**
```
Technology: Long Range Wide Area Network
Frequency: 915 MHz (US), 868 MHz (EU)
Range: 10-15 miles (rural), 1-3 miles (urban)
Data Rate: 0.3-50 kbps
Power: Ultra-low (battery lasts years)

Use Cases:
- Asset tracking
- Environmental sensors
- Smart agriculture
- Utility meters
- Pet trackers
```

**2. Mobile Network (5G):**
```
Technology: CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service)
Frequency: 3.5 GHz
Range: 0.5-1 mile
Data Rate: 100+ Mbps
Power: Standard cellular

Use Cases:
- Smartphone connectivity
- Mobile data
- Voice calls
- Video streaming
```

**3. WiFi Network:**
```
Technology: WiFi 6/6E
Frequency: 2.4/5/6 GHz
Range: 100-300 feet
Data Rate: 1+ Gbps
Power: Standard WiFi

Use Cases:

```

### Token Economics

**HNT Token:**
```
Max Supply: 223 million HNT
Halving: Every 2 years
Current Emission: ~2.5M HNT/month

Distribution:
- Hotspot rewards: 30%
- Mobile rewards: 30%
- WiFi rewards: 6%
- Validators: 6%
- Operations fund: 7%
- Investors: 21%
```

**Reward Mechanism:**
```
Hotspots earn HNT for:
1. Proof of Coverage (PoC)
2. Data Transfer
3. Witnessing other hotspots

Reward Formula:
Reward = Base × Coverage Score × Transmit Scale × Witness Quality
```

**Proof of Coverage:**
```
How it works:
1. Challenger hotspot sends beacon
2. Nearby hotspots witness beacon
3. Witnesses submit cryptographic proof
4. Blockchain verifies proofs
5. Rewards distributed

Frequency: Every ~30 minutes per hotspot
Verification: Cryptographic + geographic
```

**Data Credits (DC):**
```
Burn HNT to create DC
1 DC = $0.00001 (fixed)
DC used to pay for data transfer

Example:
Send 1 MB of data = 100,000 DC = $1
Burn ~0.0001 HNT (at $10,000 HNT price)

This creates deflationary pressure on HNT
```
