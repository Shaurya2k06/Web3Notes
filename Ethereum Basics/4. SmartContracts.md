# Smart Contracts

A Smart Contract (or cryptocontract) is a computer program that directly and automatically controls the transfer of digital assets between the parties under certain conditions. A smart contract works in the same way as a traditional contract while also automatically enforcing the contract.

## Key Characteristics

- **Distributed**: Everyone on the network is guaranteed to have a copy of all the conditions of the smart contract and they cannot be changed by one of the parties. A smart contract is replicated and distributed by all the nodes connected to the network.
- **Deterministic**: Smart contracts can only perform functions for which they are designed only when the required conditions are met. The final outcome will not vary, no matter who executes the smart contract.
- **Immutable**: Once deployed, a smart contract cannot be changed; it can only be removed as long as the functionality is implemented previously.
- **Autonomy**: There is no third party involved. The contract is made by you and shared between the parties. No intermediaries are involved, which minimizes bullying and grants full authority to the dealing parties. Also, the smart contract is maintained and executed by all the nodes on the network, thus removing all the controlling power from any one party’s hand.
- **Customizable**: Smart contracts have the ability for modification or customization before being launched to do what the user wants them to do.
- **Transparent**: Smart contracts are always stored on a public distributed ledger called blockchain, due to which the code is visible to everyone, whether or not they are participants in the smart contract.
- **Trustless**: These do not require third parties to verify the integrity of the process or to check whether the required conditions are met.
- **Self-verifying**: These are self-verifying due to automated possibilities.
- **Self-enforcing**: These are self-enforcing when the conditions and rules are met at all stages.

## Smart Legal Contract

There are legal guarantees for smart contracts. They follow the format seen in contracts: “If this occurs, then this will occur.” Legal smart contracts provide more openness between contracting entities than traditional documents because they are stored on blockchain and cannot be altered.

## Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

DAOs are democratic organizations with voting powers granted by a smart contract. A decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, is a blockchain-based entity with a shared goal under collective governance. There is no such thing as an executive or president. Instead, the organization’s operations and the distribution of assets are governed by blockchain-based principles that are incorporated into the contract’s code. One example of this kind of smart contract is VitaDAO, which uses technology to power a community dedicated to scientific inquiry.

## Application Logic Contracts (ALCs)

Application-based code that usually keeps up with multiple other blockchain contracts makes up application logic contracts, or ALCs. It permits device-to-device interactions such as blockchain integration and the Internet of Things. These are signed between computers and other contracts rather than between people or organizations like other kinds of smart contracts.

## Benefits of Smart Contracts

- **Recordkeeping**: All contract transactions are stored in chronological order in the blockchain and can be accessed along with the complete audit trail. However, the parties involved can be secured cryptographically for full privacy.
- **Autonomy**: There are direct dealings between parties. Smart contracts remove the need for intermediaries and allow for transparent, direct relationships with customers.
- **Reduce Fraud**: Fraudulent activity detection and reduction. Smart contracts are stored in the blockchain. Forcefully modifying the blockchain is very difficult as it’s computation-intensive. Also, a violation of the smart contract can be detected by the nodes in the network and such a violation attempt is marked invalid and not stored in the blockchain.
- **Fault-tolerance**: Since no single person or entity is in control of the digital assets, one-party domination and the situation of one party backing out do not happen as the platform is decentralized. Even if one node detaches itself from the network, the contract remains intact.
- **Enhanced Trust**: Business agreements are automatically executed and enforced. Plus, these agreements are immutable and therefore unbreakable and undeniable.
- **Cost-efficiency**: The application of smart contracts eliminates the need for intermediaries (brokers, lawyers, notaries, witnesses, etc.), leading to reduced costs. It also eliminates paperwork, leading to paper saving and money-saving.
