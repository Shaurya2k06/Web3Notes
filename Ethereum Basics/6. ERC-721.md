### ERC721

ERC721 is a standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike ERC20 tokens, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, ERC721 tokens are unique and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis. Each ERC721 token has a distinct value and properties.

### Key Features of ERC721
- **Uniqueness**: Each ERC721 token has a unique identifier (token ID) that distinguishes it from other tokens. This uniqueness is what makes them suitable for representing ownership of digital assets, collectibles, and other one-of-a-kind items.
- **Metadata**: ERC721 tokens can include metadata that provides additional information about the token, such as its name, description, and image. This metadata is often stored off-chain and linked to the token on the blockchain.
- **Interoperability**: Like ERC20 tokens, ERC721 tokens can be easily integrated into existing Ethereum infrastructure, including wallets, marketplaces, and dApps, enabling a wide range of use cases.

### Conclusion
The ERC721 standard has been instrumental in the rise of NFTs, providing a framework for creating and managing unique digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain. Its focus on individuality and metadata has opened up new possibilities for artists, creators, and collectors in the digital space.
