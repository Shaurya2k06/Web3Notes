# Sharding in Blockchain

Sharding is a concept borrowed from traditional database management. It refers to the process of splitting a larger database into smaller, more manageable parts, called shards. Its application in blockchain aims to improve scalability while maintaining the principle of decentralization. In essence, sharding occurs when a blockchain network is divided into smaller parts known as shards, each capable of parallelly processing transactions and smart contracts.

## Sequential vs. Parallel Processing

Typically, each blockchain node is responsible for handling all of the transaction volume within the network. This type of data processing is commonly referred to as sequential processing. This implies that every node must maintain and store all critical information, such as account balances and transaction history. In essence, each node must process all network operations, data, and transactions.

Though such a model bolsters the security of the blockchain by recording every transaction across all nodes, it dramatically slows down the processing of data. This is where parallel processing of data comes into play as it allows for multiple operations to be executed concurrently.

## How Sharding Works

Sharding can be a potent solution to this predicament as it divides or 'partitions' the transactional workload across the blockchain network. This means that not all nodes need to manage or process the entirety of the blockchain's load.

### Horizontal Partitioning

Sharding segregates the workload through horizontal partitioning. In this process, the data is divided into horizontal subsets, with each shard acting as an independent database capable of processing transactions separately from the others.

In horizontal partitioning, the data is divided into rows and spread across different nodes (or databases), each containing a subset of the data. Each row in a table is a unique entity, so separating them doesn't lead to any loss of data integrity. A prominent example of horizontal partitioning in use is in the distribution of blockchain networks, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.

### Vertical Partitioning

In vertical partitioning, the data is divided into columns, rather than rows. Each partition in vertical partitioning contains a subset of data for each entity, or the entire dataset, but only for a certain set of attributes. For instance, consider a customer table with columns like Name, Status, Description, and Photo. In a vertical partitioning scenario, the 'Name' and 'Status' might be kept in one table, and 'Description' and 'Photo' in another.

## Benefits of Sharding

- **Increased Transaction Speed**: Sharding facilitates parallel processing of transactions. Instead of processing transactions one by one in a sequential manner, sharding allows transactions to be processed simultaneously but on different shards.
- **Minimized Processing and Storage Costs**: The conventional blockchain design obliges every node to store all transactions, intensifying the demands on hardware as the blockchain grows. But with sharding, each node is responsible for processing and storing just a fraction of the entire network's dataâ€”this decreases the resources necessary for a node to participate in the network.
- **Improved Network Performance**: Sharding can help to improve overall network performance and capacity.

## Challenges of Sharding

- **Single Shard Takeover Attacks**: In a sharding environment, the computational power to take over a single shard is dramatically less than the power required to take over the entire network.

## Sharding in Ethereum

Ethereum has plans to implement sharding as part of their Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. As of now, the upgrade is being implemented in phases, with the final phase (Phase 2) including the full implementation of sharding. Ethereum developers hope that these enhancements will address some of the current challenges associated with scalability and transaction cost that the network is facing.

## Conclusion

Sharding presents a promising solution to the scalability issues faced by blockchain networks. By dividing the workload and allowing for parallel processing, sharding can significantly enhance transaction speeds, reduce costs, and improve overall network performance. However, it also introduces new challenges, such as the risk of single shard takeover attacks, which must be carefully managed.
