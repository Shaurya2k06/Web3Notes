# Ethereum Plasma

## Overview
The main idea of the Ethereum Plasma is to establish a framework of secondary chains that will communicate and interact with the main Ethereum chain. Plasma chains are designed to handle transactions and smart contracts off the main chain, thereby increasing scalability and reducing congestion on the Ethereum network.

## Key Features
- **Scalability**: Plasma allows for the creation of child chains that can process transactions independently, thus offloading the main chain.
- **Security**: Plasma chains inherit the security of the Ethereum main chain, ensuring that transactions are secure and verifiable.
- **Interoperability**: Plasma chains can interact with each other and the main Ethereum chain, allowing for a flexible and interconnected ecosystem.
- **Reduced Fees**: By processing transactions off-chain, Plasma can significantly reduce transaction fees compared to those on the main Ethereum chain.w
