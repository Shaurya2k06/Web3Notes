# Chain Abstraction

Chain abstraction is NEARâ€™s idea of simplifying how users interact with blockchain technology by separating it from the user experience (UX). The goal is that users should not be aware of the specific blockchain they are interacting with or even realize that they are using a blockchain.

The goal of chain abstraction is to remove or hide the complexities of blockchain technology, allowing users to focus on the functionality and benefits of the DApps they use. For instance, if Sarah wants to use a new DApp called XYZ, she should not have to worry about which blockchain it is built on. From a user perspective, she just wants it to work well and fulfill its purpose.

## Benefits of Chain Abstraction

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can interact with DApps without needing to understand the underlying blockchain technology.
2. **Interoperability**: DApps can be built to work across multiple blockchains, providing more flexibility and options for developers and users.
3. **Security**: By abstracting the blockchain layer, security measures can be standardized and improved, reducing the risk of user errors.
4. **Adoption**: Simplifying the user experience can lead to greater adoption of blockchain technology as it becomes more accessible to non-technical users.

## Examples of Chain Abstraction

- **Meta Transactions**: Allow users to interact with DApps without needing to hold the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain.
- **Cross-Chain Bridges**: Enable assets and data to move seamlessly between different blockchains.
- **Unified Wallets**: Provide a single interface for users to manage assets across multiple blockchains.
