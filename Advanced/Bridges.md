## Blockchain Bridges

### Introduction:
- **Definition:** Blockchain bridges are protocols that connect two or more distinct blockchain networks, allowing for the transfer of assets and data between them. 
- **Purpose:** Facilitate cross-chain communication, enhance liquidity, and expand the functionality of decentralized applications (dApps).
- **Types of Bridges:**
  - **Centralized Bridges:** Operated by a single entity, which holds custody of the assets being transferred.
  - **Decentralized Bridges:** Utilize smart contracts and multiple validators to ensure trustless and secure transfers.
    - **Hybrid Bridges:** Combine elements of both centralized and decentralized approaches.

### Key Features:
- **Cross-Chain Asset Transfers:** Enable users to move tokens and assets between different blockchains.
- **Interoperability:** Allow dApps on different blockchains to interact and share data.
- **Liquidity Pools:** Some bridges use liquidity pools to facilitate faster and cheaper transfers.
- **Security Mechanisms:** Include multi-signature wallets, fraud proofs, and time locks to enhance security.
- **User Experience:** Many bridges offer user-friendly interfaces to simplify the transfer process.
- **Lower transaction fees:** Let’s say you have ETH on Ethereum Mainnet but want cheaper transaction fees to explore different dapps. By bridging your ETH from the Mainnet to an Ethereum L2 rollup, you can enjoy lower transaction fees.
